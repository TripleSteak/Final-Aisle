# Final-Aisle
**Built:** September 2020 â€“ June 2021

Welcome to **Final Aisle**, what was going to be the first step to a multiplayer role-playing game that would take place in a predominantly food-themed world. This was, for the most part, a high school Unity/sockets learning project that didn't have a particular end goal defined. I played around with both a 2D and 3D Unity game client, but never got around to populating the world with more gameplay content :(

## Features
- A fantastical side-scrolling platformer-style 2D game client that takes place in a broccoli forest. Footage [here](https://youtu.be/RIUmXqQ7mWw);
- A beautiful 3D low-poly open world with a couple of tents and a cozy fire pit. Footage [here](https://youtu.be/5nATSPeDM44);
- Centralized multiplayer server system driven by custom TCP packet communication, reinforced with compression and symmetric encryption;
- Real-time multiplayer movements, including jumping, rolling, and crouching;
- An account registration and creation system accompanied by SMTP email verification; and
- Some degree of quirky character customization!
